This is a solution manual for the exercises in [_Introduction to Probability, Second Edition_](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Probability-Chapman-Statistical-Science/dp/1138369918) by Joseph Blitzstein and Jessica Hwang.

The project is currently **in development**, but the latest version can be found at https://fifthist.github.io/probability-solutions-manual/

The project uses R Markdown and **bookdown** (https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown) to organize R Markdown files into a book format. Refer to the bookdown documentation for details.

## Numbering

The format for numbering solutions is **[Chapter].[Section].[Exercise]**

For example, problem 19 from the _Story Proofs_ exercise section (2) of the _Probability and Counting_ chapter (1) is numbered as 1.2.5 since it is the fifth problem of the section.
