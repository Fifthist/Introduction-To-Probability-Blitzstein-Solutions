<p>Imagine eleven empty slots to place the letters into.</p>
<p>How many ways are there to place the four <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span>-s into the slots? For each placement of <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span>s, can we figure out the number of ways to place the remaining letters into the <span class="math inline">\(7\)</span> empty slots?</p>
<p><details> <summary><strong>Solution</strong></summary></p>
<p>We have one <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>, four <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span>-s, four <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>-s, and two <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>-s.

<p>If the first digit can’t be <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>, how many choices are we left with for the first digit? For each choice of first digit, how many choices do we have for the remaining six digits?</p>
<p><details> <summary><strong>Solution</strong></summary></p>
<p>If the first digit can’t be <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>, we have eight choices for the first digit - <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(9\)</span>.

<p>We can subtract the number of phone numbers that start with <span class="math inline">\(911\)</span> from the total number of phone numbers we found in the previous part.</p>
<p>If a phone number starts with <span class="math inline">\(911\)</span>, it has ten choices for each of the remaining four digits.</p>

<p>For the first restaurant, Fred has <span class="math inline">\(10\)</span> choices. For all subsequent days, Fred has <span class="math inline">\(9\)</span> choices, since the only restriction is that he doesn’t want to eat at the restaurant he ate at the previous day.</p>

<p>How many rounds need to pass for a single player to be left standing?</p>
<p><details> <summary><strong>Solution</strong></summary></p>
<p>By the end of each round, half of the players participating in the round are eliminated. So, the problem reduces to finding out how many times the number of players can be halved before a single player is left.</p>
<p>The number of times <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> can be divided by two is <span class="math display">\[\log_{2}{N}\]</span> </details></p>

<p><details> <summary><strong>Solution</strong></summary></p>
<p>The number of games in a given round is <span class="math inline">\(\frac{N_{r}}{2}\)</span>. We can sum up these values for all the rounds.</p>
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}

<p>There are <span class="math inline">\({7 \choose 3}\)</span> ways to assign three wins to player <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>. For a specific combination of three games won by <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, there are <span class="math inline">\({4 \choose 2}\)</span> ways to assign two draws to <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>.

<p>List the possible outcomes of games that award <span class="math inline">\(4\)</span> points to <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>.</p>
<p><details> <summary><strong>Solution</strong></summary></p>
<p>If <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> were to draw every game, there would need to be at least <span class="math inline">\(8\)</span> games for <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> to obtain <span class="math inline">\(4\)</span> points, so <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> has to win at least <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> game. Similarly, if <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> wins more than <span class="math inline">\(4\)</span> games, they will have more than <span class="math inline">\(4\)</span> points.</p>
<p>Case 1: <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> wins <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> game and draws <span class="math inline">\(6\)</span>.</p>
<p>This case amounts to selecting <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> out of <span class="math inline">\(7\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> to win and assigning a draw for the other <span class="math inline">\(6\)</span> games.

<p>Case 2: <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> wins <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> games and draws <span class="math inline">\(4\)</span>.</p>
<p>There are <span class="math inline">\({7 \choose 2}\)</span> ways to assign <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> wins to <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>. For each of them, there are <span class="math inline">\({5 \choose 4}\)</span> ways to assign four draws to <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> out of the remaining <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span> games. Player <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> wins the remaining game. The total number of possibilites for this case is <span class="math inline">\({7 \choose 2} \times {5 \choose 4}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Case 3: <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> wins <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span> games and draws <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>.</p>
<p>There are <span class="math inline">\({7 \choose 3}\)</span> ways to assign <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span> wins to <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>.

<p>Case 4: <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> wins <span class="math inline">\(4\)</span> games and loses <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>.</p>
<p>There are <span class="math inline">\({7 \choose 4}\)</span> ways to assign <span class="math inline">\(4\)</span> wins to <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>. <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> wins the remaining <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span> games.

<p>Summing up the number of possibilities in each of the cases we get</p>

<p>Count the number of possibilites for the case when <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> wins the last game and the number of possibilities for the case when <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> draws the last game.</p>
<p><details> <summary><strong>Solution</strong></summary></p>
<p>If <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> were to win the last game, that would mean that <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> had already obtained <span class="math inline">\(4\)</span> points prior to the last game, so the last game would not be played at all. Hence, <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> could not have won the last game.</p>
<p>Case 1: <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> wins <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span> out of the first <span class="math inline">\(6\)</span> games and wins the last game.</p>
<p>There are <span class="math inline">\({6 \choose 3}\)</span> ways to assign <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span> wins to <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> out of the first <span class="math inline">\(6\)</span> games.

<p><details> <summary><strong>Solution</strong></summary></p>
<p>Consider the right hand side of the equation. Since a committe chair can only be selected from the first group, there are <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> ways to choose them. Then, for each choice of a committee chair, there are <span class="math inline">\({2n-1 \choose n-1}\)</span> ways to choose the remaining members.

<p>Now consider the left side of the equation.

<p>Suppose Tony is in a group by himself. How many ways are there to group the remaining <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> people?</p>

<p><details> <summary><strong>Solution</strong></summary></p>
<p>Case 1: If Tony is in a group by himself, then we have to break the remaining <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> people into <span class="math inline">\(k-1\)</span> groups. This can be done in <span class="math display">\[

<p>Case 2: If Tony is not in a group by himself, then we first break up the remaining <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> people into <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> groups. Then, Tony can join any of them. The number of possible groups then is <span class="math display">\[

<p>Case 1 and 2 together count the number of ways to break up <span class="math inline">\(n+1\)</span> people into <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> non empty groups, which is precisely what the left side of the equation counts.</p>

<p>Say Tony wants to have <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> in his group. That is to say he does not want <span class="math inline">\(n-m\)</span> people. These <span class="math inline">\(n-m\)</span> people must then be broken into <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> groups.</p>
<p>The number of people Tony wants to join his group can range from <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(n-k\)</span>. The reason for the upper bound is that at least <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> people are required to make up the remaining <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> groups.</p>
<p>Taking the sum over the number of people in Tony’s group we get <span class="math display">\[\sum_{j=0}^{n-k}{n \choose j}\left\{

<p>Now, instead of taking the sum over the number of people Tony wants in his group, we can equivalently take the sum over the number of people Tony does not want in his group. Hence,</p>

<p>Let us count the number of games in a round-robin tournament with <span class="math inline">\(n+1\)</span> participants in two ways.</p>

<p>Method 2: The first player participates in <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> games. The second one also participates in <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> games, but we have already counted the game against the first player, so we only care about <span class="math inline">\(n-1\)</span> games.

<p>LHS: If <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is chosen first, then the subsequent <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span> numbers can be any of <span class="math inline">\(0, 1, \dots, n-1\)</span>. These <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span> numbers are chosen with replacement resulting in <span class="math inline">\(n^{3}\)</span> possibilities. Summing over possible values of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> we get <span class="math inline">\(1^{3} + 2^{3} + \dots + n^{3}\)</span> total number of possibilities.</p>
<p>RHS: We can count the number of permutations of the <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span> numbers chosen with replacement from a different perspective. The <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span> numbers can either all be distinct, or all be the same, or differ in exactly <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> value.</p>
<p>Case 1: All <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span> numbers are distinct.</p>
<p>Selecting <span class="math inline">\(4\)</span> (don’t forget the very first, largest selected number) distinct numbers can be done in <span class="math inline">\({n+1 \choose 4}\)</span> ways. The <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span> smaller numbers are free to permute amongst themselves. This gives us a total of <span class="math inline">\(6{n+1 \choose 4}\)</span> possibilities.</p>
<p>Case 2: All <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span> numbers are the same.</p>
<p>In this case, we have to select <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> digits. The smaller digit will be sampled <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span> times and there are no ways to permute identical numbers, so the number of possiblities is <span class="math inline">\({n+1 \choose 2}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Case 3: Two of the <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span> numbers are distinct.</p>
<p>In this case, we have to select <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span> digits in total. One of the smaller <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> digits will be sampled twice, giving us <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span> permutations. Since, there are <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> choices for which digit gets sampled twice, we get a total of <span class="math inline">\(6\)</span> permutations. The total number of possibilities then is <span class="math inline">\(6{n+1 \choose 3}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Adding up the number of possibilities in each of the cases we get a total of <span class="math display">\[6{n+1 \choose 4} + 6{n+1 \choose 3} + {n+1 \choose 2}\]</span> possibilities.</p>
<p>Since the LHS and the RHS count the same set, they are equal.</p>

<p><strong>Intuition</strong></p>
<p>Suppose all three people are going to the same floor, how many choice are there?</p>
<p>What if only two of them are going to the same floor? What if they are all going to different floors?</p>
<p><details> <summary><strong>Solution</strong></summary></p>
<p>Case 1: All three go to the same floor.</p>
<p>They can go to floors <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(10\)</span> for a total of <span class="math inline">\(9\)</span> choices.</p>
<p>Case 2: Two of them go to the same floor.</p>
<p>There are <span class="math inline">\(9 \choose 2\)</span> possibilities in this case.</p>
<p>Case 3: They all go to different floors.</p>
<p>There are <span class="math inline">\(9 \choose 3\)</span> possibilities in this case.</p>
<p>We are interested in the case of <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span> consecutive floors. There are <span class="math inline">\(7\)</span> equally likely possibilities <span class="math display">\[(2, 3, 4), (3, 4, 5), (4, 5, 6), (5, 6, 7), (6, 7, 8), (7, 8, 9), (8, 9, 10).\]</span></p>
<p>Hence, the probability that the buttons for <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span> consecutive floors are pressed is <span class="math display">\[\frac{7}{9 + {9 \choose 2} + {9 \choose 3}}\]</span></p>
