\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]

\item Inequality can be demonstrated using the first property of probabilities,
$$P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)$$ and the first axiom of probabilities,
$$P(S) = 1.$$

$P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B) \leq 1 \implies P(A) + P(B) - 1 \leq P(A \cap B)$. 

Strict equality holds if and only if $A \cup B = S$ where $S$ is the sample space.

\item Since $A \cap B \subseteq A \cup B$, $P(A \cap B) \leq P(A \cup B)$ by
 the second property of probabilites.

Strict equality holds if and only if $A = B.$

\item Inequality follows directly from the first property of probabilities
 with strict equality if and only if $P(A \cap B) = 0.$
