\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item Consider the experiment of flipping a fair coin twice. The sample space $S$ is $\{HH, HT, TH, TT\}.$ Let $A$ be the event that the first flip lands heads and $B$ be the event that the second flip lands heads. $P(A \cap B) = \frac{1}{4}$ since $A \cap B$ corresponds to the outcome $HH$. 

On the other hand, $A$ corresponds to the outcomes $\{HH, HT\}$ and $B$ corresponds to the outcomes $\{HH, TH\}$. Thus, 
$P(A) = P(B) = \frac{1}{2}.$

Since $P(A \cap B) = P(A)P(B),$ $A$ and $B$ are independent events.

\item $A_{1}$ and $B_{1}$ should intersect such that the ratio of the area of $A_{1} \cap B_{1}$ to the area of $A_{1}$ equals the ratio of the area of $B_{1}$ to the area of $R$.

As a simple, extreme case, if $A_{1} = B_{1},$ then $A$ and $B$ are dependent, since the condition above is violated.

\item 
\begin{flalign}
P(A \cup B) & = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B) \nonumber && \\
 & = P(A) + P(B) - P(A)P(B) \nonumber && \\
 & = P(A)(1 - P(B)) + P(B) \nonumber && \\
 & = P(A)P(B^{c}) + P(B) \nonumber && \\
 & = P(A)P(B^{c}) + 1 - P(B^{c}) \nonumber && \\
 & = 1 + P(B^{c})(P(A) - 1) \nonumber && \\
 & = 1 - P(B^{c})P(A^{c}) \nonumber
\end{flalign}
