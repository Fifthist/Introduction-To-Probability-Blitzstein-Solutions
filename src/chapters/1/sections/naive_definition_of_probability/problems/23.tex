Case 1: All three go to the same floor.

They can go to floors $2$ to $10$ for a total of $9$ choices.

Case 2: Two of them go to the same floor.

There are $9 \choose 2$ possibilities in this case.

Case 3: They all go to different floors.

There are $9 \choose 3$ possibilities in this case.

We are interested in the case of $3$ consecutive floors. There are $7$ equally 
likely possibilities $$(2, 3, 4), (3, 4, 5), (4, 5, 6), (5, 6, 7), 
(6, 7, 8), (7, 8, 9), (8, 9, 10).$$

Hence, the probability that the buttons for $3$ consecutive floors are 
pressed is $$\frac{7}{9 + {9 \choose 2} + {9 \choose 3}}$$
