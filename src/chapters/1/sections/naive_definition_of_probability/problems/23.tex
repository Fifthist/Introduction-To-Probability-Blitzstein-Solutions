We are interested in the case of $3$ consecutive floors. There are $7$ equally 
likely possibilities $$(2, 3, 4), (3, 4, 5), (4, 5, 6), (5, 6, 7), 
(6, 7, 8), (7, 8, 9), (8, 9, 10).$$

For each of this possibilities, there are $3$ ways for $1$ person to choose 
button, $2$ for second and $1$ for third ($3!$ in total by multiplication rule).

So number of favorable combinations is $$7 * 3!$$

Generally each person have $9$ floors to choose from so for $3$ people there are 
$9^3$ combinations by multiplication rule.

Hence, the probability that the buttons for $3$ consecutive floors are pressed
is $$\frac{7 * 3!}{9^3}$$
