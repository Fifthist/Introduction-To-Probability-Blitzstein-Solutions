\item  Ignore all the cards except $J,Q,K,A$.  There are $16$ of those, $4$ of which are aces.  Each card has an equal chance of being first in the list, so the answer is $\frac 14$.

\item Ignore all the cards except $J,Q,K,A$. There are $4$ choices for a king, $4$ choices for a queen and $4$ choices for a jack with $3!$ permutations of the cards. Then, there are $4$ choices for an ace. The remaining $12$ cards can be permuted in $12!$
ways, so the answer is $\frac{4^{3}\times3!\times4\times12!}{16!}$.
