\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item Counting strictly increasing sequences of $k$ numbers amounts to counting 
the number of ways to select $k$ elements out of the $n$, since for any such 
selection, there is exactly one increasing ordering. Thus, the answer is 
$$\frac{\binom{n}{k}}{n^k}$$

\item The problem can be thought of sampling with replacement where order 
doesn't matter, since there is only one non decreasing ordering of a given 
sequence of $k$ numbers. Thus, the answer is
$$\frac{\binom{n-1+k}{k}}{n^k}$$
