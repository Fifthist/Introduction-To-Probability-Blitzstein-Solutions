\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item  When sampling with replacement, the probability of any sample of size 
$1000$ is $$\frac{1}{K^{1000}}$$ where $K$ is the size of the population. 
However, if sampling is done without replacement, then the probability is 
$$\frac{1}{K(K-1) \dots (K-1000+1)}$$ which is different from the result in 
the birthday problem.

\item $$P(A) = 1 - P(A^{c}) = 1 - \frac{K(K-1) \dots (K-1000+1)}{K^{1000}}$$ 
where $K = 1000000$.
