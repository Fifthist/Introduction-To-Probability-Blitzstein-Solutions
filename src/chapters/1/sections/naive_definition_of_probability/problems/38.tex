\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item  There are $11$ choices of seats for Tyron and Cersei so that they sit next to each other. Tyron can sit to the left or to the right of Cersei. The remaining $10$ people can be ordered in $10!$ ways, so the answer is
$$\frac{22\times10!}{12!} = \frac{1}{6}$$

\item There are $\binom{12}{2}$ choices of seats to be assigned to Tyron and Cersei, but only $11$ choices where they sit next to each other. Since every assignment of seats is equally likely the answer is
$$\frac{11}{\binom{12}{2}} = \frac{1}{6}$$
