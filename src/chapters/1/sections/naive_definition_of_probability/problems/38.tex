\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item  There are $12$ choices of seats for Tyron and Cersei so that they sit 
next to each other ($11$ cases, where they take $i-1$ and $i$ positions and 
1 case, where they take 1 and 12th position, because table is round). 
Tyron can sit to the left or to the right of Cersei.  
The remaining $10$ people can be ordered in $10!$ ways, so the answer is
$$\frac{24\times10!}{12!} = \frac{2}{11}$$

\item There are $\binom{12}{2}$ choices of seats to be assigned to Tyron and 
Cersei, but only $12$ choices where they sit next to each other. 
Since every assignment of seats is equally likely the answer is
$$\frac{12}{\binom{12}{2}} = \frac{2}{11}$$

\end{enumerate}
