There are $4$ choices for sizes and $9$ choices for toppings for a total of $36$ 
possibilities for a single pizza. Since we are ordering $2$ pizzas, we get $36^{2}$ 
possibilities. However, this result overcounts the desired quantity by 
a factor of $2$, since

\begin{enumerate}
\item Small Vegetarian, Large Pepperoni

\item Large Pepperoni, Small Vegetarian
\end{enumerate}

describe the same order. The number of possibilities then is $$\frac{36^{2}}{2}$$
