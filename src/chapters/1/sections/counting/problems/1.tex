There are \[\binom{11}{4}\] ways to select $4$ positions for $I$, \[\binom{7}{4}\]

ways to select $4$ postions for $S$, \[\binom{3}{2}\] ways to selection $2$ 
positions for $P$ leaving us with a single choice of position for $M$. In total, 
we get
\[\binom{11}{4}\binom{7}{4}\binom{3}{2}\binom{1}{1}\] permutations.
