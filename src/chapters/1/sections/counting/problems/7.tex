\item There are ${7 \choose 3}$ ways to assign three wins to player $A$. For a 
specific combination of three games won by $A$, there are ${4 \choose 2}$ ways 
to assign two draws to $A$. There is only one way to assign two losses to $A$ 
from the remaining two games, namely, $A$ losses both games.

  $$ {7 \choose 3} \times {4 \choose 2} \times {2 \choose 2} $$

\item   If $A$ were to draw every game, there would need to be at least $8$ 
games for $A$ to obtain $4$ points, so $A$ has to win at least $1$ game. 
Similarly, if $A$ wins more than $4$ games, they will have more than $4$ points.
  
  Case 1: $A$ wins $1$ game and draws $6$.
  
  This case amounts to selecting $1$ out of $7$ for $A$ to win and assigning a 
  draw for the other $6$ games. Hence, there are $7$ possibilities.
    
  Case 2: $A$ wins $2$ games and draws $4$.
  
  There are ${7 \choose 2}$ ways to assign $2$ wins to $A$. For each of them, 
  there are ${5 \choose 4}$ ways to assign four draws to $A$ out of the 
  remaining $5$ games. Player $B$ wins the remaining game. The total number 
  of possibilites for this case is ${7 \choose 2} \times {5 \choose 4}$.
  
  Case 3: $A$ wins $3$ games and draws $2$.
  
  There are ${7 \choose 3}$ ways to assign $3$ wins to $A$. For each of them, 
  there are ${4 \choose 2}$ ways to assign two draws to $A$ out of the remaining 
  $4$ games. $B$ wins the remaining $2$ games. The total number of possibilites 
  for this case is ${7 \choose 3} \times {4 \choose 2}$.
  
  Case 4: $A$ wins $4$ games and loses $3$.
  
  There are ${7 \choose 4}$ ways to assign $4$ wins to $A$. $B$ wins the 
  remaining $3$ games.
  The total number of possibilites for this case is ${7 \choose 4}$.
  
  Summing up the number of possibilities in each of the cases we get
  
  $$ {7 \choose 1} + {7 \choose 2} \times {5 \choose 4} + {7 \choose 3} \times 
  {4 \choose 2} + {7 \choose 4} $$

\item If $B$ were to win the last game, that would mean that $A$ had already 
obtained $4$ points prior to the last game, so the last game would not be 
played at all. Hence, $B$ could not have won the last game.
  
  Case 1: $A$ wins $3$ out of the first $6$ games and wins the last game.
  
  There are ${6 \choose 3}$ ways to assign $3$ wins to $A$ out of the first $6$ 
  games. The other $3$ games end in a draw. The number of possibilities then 
  is ${6 \choose 3}$.
  
  Case 2: $A$ wins $2$ and draws $2$ out of the first $6$ games and wins the 
  last game.
  
  There are ${6 \choose 2}$ ways to assign $2$ wins to $A$ out of the first 
  $6$ games. From the $4$ remaining games, there are ${4 \choose 2}$ ways to 
  assign $2$ draws. The remaining $2$ games are won by $B$. The number of 
  possibilities is ${6 \choose 2} \times {4 \choose 2}$.
  
  Case 3: The last game ends in a draw.
  
  This case implies that $A$ had $3.5$ and $B$ had $2.5$ points by the end of 
  game $6$.
  
  Case 3.1: $A$ wins $3$ and draws $1$ out of the first $6$ games.
  
  There are ${6 \choose 3}$ ways to assign $3$ wins to $A$ out of the first 
  $6$ games. There are ${3 \choose 1}$ ways to assign a draw out of the 
  remaining $3$ games. $B$ wins the other $2$ games. The number of 
  possibilities is ${6 \choose 3} \times {3 \choose 1}$.
  
  Case 3.2: $A$ wins $2$ and draws $3$ out of the first $6$ games.
   
  There are ${6 \choose 2}$ ways to assign $2$ wins to $A$ out of the 
  first $6$ games. There are ${4 \choose 3}$ ways to assign $3$ draws out of 
  the remaining $4$ games. $B$ wins the remaining game. The number of 
  possibilities is ${6 \choose 2} \times {4 \choose 3}$.
  
  Case 3.3: $A$ wins $1$ and draws $5$ of the first $6$ games.
  
  There are ${6 \choose 1}$ ways to assign a win to $A$ out of the first 
  $6$ games.
  
  The total number of possibilities then is
  
  $$ {6 \choose 3} + {6 \choose 2} \times {4 \choose 2} + {6 \choose 3} \times 
  {3 \choose 1} + {6 \choose 2} \times {4 \choose 3} + {6 \choose 1}$$
