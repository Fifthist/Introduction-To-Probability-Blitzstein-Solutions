\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item Fred has $10$ choices for Monday, $9$ choices for Tuesday, $8$ choices for Wednesday, $7$ choices for Thursday and $6$ choices for Friday. 

  $$ 10 \times 9 \times 8 \times 7 \times6 $$

\item For the first restaurant, Fred has $10$ choices. For all subsequent days, Fred has $9$ choices, since the only restriction is that he doesn't want to eat at the restaurant he ate at the previous day.

  $$ 10 \times 9^{4} $$
