\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item $${52 \choose 13}$$

\item The number of ways to break $52$ cards into $4$ groups of size $13$ is 
$$\frac{{52 \choose 13}{39 \choose 13}{26 \choose 13}{13 \choose 13}}{4!}$$.
  
  The reason for dividision by $4!$ is that all permutations of specific $4$ 
  groups describe the same way to group $52$ cards.
  
  Since we do care about the order of the $4$ groups, we should not divide by 
  ${4!}$. The final answer then is 
  $${52 \choose 13}{39 \choose 13}{26 \choose 13}{13 \choose 13}$$

\item The key is to notice that the sampling is done without replacement. 
${52 \choose 13}^{4}$ assumes that all four players have ${52 \choose 13}$ 
choices of hands available to them. This would be true if sampling was done 
with replacement.
