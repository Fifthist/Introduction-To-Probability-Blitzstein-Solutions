We are interested in two outcomes of the samme sample space. 
This is, $S = \{(a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3}) : a_{i} \in \{1, 2, 3, ..., 365\}\}$
The first outcome is $(1, 1, 1)$, and the second outcome is $(1, 2, 3)$.
The answer follows, since every outcome of the sample space is equally likely.

\item $<$ 

If the first toss is $T$, Martin can never win, since as soon as $H$ is seen on any subsequent toss, the game stops, and Gale is awarded the win.

If the first toss is $H$, then if the second toss is also $H$, Martin wins. Otherwise, if the second toss is $T$, Gale wins, since as soon as a subsequent toss shows $H$, Gale is awarded a win.

Thus, Martin loses $\frac{3}{4}$ of the time.
