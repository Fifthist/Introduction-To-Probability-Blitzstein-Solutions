\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item $n^{n}$

\item $\binom{2n-1}{n-1}$

\item The least likely bootstrap sample is one where $a_{1} = a_{2} = \cdots = a_{n}$. Such a sample occurs with probability $\frac{1}{n^{n}}$. The most likely bootstrap sample is one where all the terms are different. Such a sample occurs with probability $\frac{n!}{n^{n}}$. Thus, the ratio of the probabilities is $n!$
