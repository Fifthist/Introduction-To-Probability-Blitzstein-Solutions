\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item $\binom{15+9}{9}$

\item $\binom{5+9}{9}$

\item 
Each of 15 bars can be given to any of 10 children, so by orderd sampling with replcement
formula we have $10^{15}$ combinations

\item
To count amount of suitable combinations, we can subtract amount of combination, where at
least one child doesn't get any bars (is example of inclusion-exclusion usage case) from
total amount of combinations.\\
$10^{15} - \sum_{i=1}^{9}\left(-1\right)^{i+1}\binom{10}{i}\left(10-i\right)^{15}$
\end{enumerate}
