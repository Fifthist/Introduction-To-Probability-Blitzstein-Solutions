Since the subsets have size $5$, a middle element can range from $3$ to $n+1$. Let us label middle elements as $k+1$. Then, there are ${k \choose 2}$ choises of elements for the left half of a subset and ${n+3-(k+1) \choose 2} = {n+2-k \choose 2}$ choices for the right half.

Taking the sum as $k+1$ ranges from $3$ to $n+1$, we get the desired result.
