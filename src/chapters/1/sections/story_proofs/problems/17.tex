${2n \choose n}$ counts the number of ways to sample $n$ objects from a 
set of $2n$. Instead of sampling from the whole set, we can break the set into 
two sets of size $n$ each. Then, we have to sample $n$ objects in total 
from both sets. 

We can sample all $n$ objects from the first set, or $1$ object from the 
first set and $n-1$ objects from the second set, or $2$ objects from the first 
set and $n-2$ objects from the second set and so on.

There are ${n \choose n}$ ways to sample all $n$ objects from the first set, 
${n \choose 1} {n \choose n-1}$ ways to sample $1$ object from the first set 
and $n-1$ objects from the second set, ${n \choose 2} {n \choose n-2}$ ways to 
sample $2$ objects from the first set and $n-2$ objects from the second set. 
The pattern is clear 
$$ \sum_{k=0}^{n} {n \choose k} {n \choose n-k} = \sum_{k=0}^{n} {n \choose k}^{2}$$
