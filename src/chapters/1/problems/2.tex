\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item If the first digit can't be $0$ or $1$, we have eight choices for the first digit. The remaining six digits can be anything from $0$ to $9$. Hence, the solution is
  $$ 8 \times 10^{6}$$

\item We can subtract the number of phone numbers that start with $911$ from the total number of phone numbers we found in the previous part. 

If a phone number starts with $911$, it has ten choices for each of the remaining four digits.

  $$ 8 \times 10^{6} - 10^{4} $$
\end{enumerate}
