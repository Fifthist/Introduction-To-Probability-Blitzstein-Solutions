\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item There are ${n \choose 2}$ matches. 

For a given match, there are two outcomes. Each match has two possible outcomes. We can use the multiplication rule to count the total possible outcomes.

  $$ 2^{{n \choose 2}} $$

\item Since every player plays every other player exactly once, the number of games is the number of ways to pair up $n$ people.

  $$ {n \choose 2} $$
