\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item $$OR = \frac{P(D|C)}{P(D^{c}|C)} * \frac{P(D^{c}|C^{c})}{P
(D|C^{c})}$$

Since the disease is rare among both exposed and not exposed groups, $P(D^{c}|C)
\approx 1$ and $P(D^{c}|C^{c}) \approx 1$. Thus,

$$OR \approx \frac{P(D|C)}{P(D|C^{c})} = RR$$

\item 
$$\frac{P(C,D)P(C^{c}, D^{c})}{P(C, D^{c}){P(C^{c}, D)}} = \frac{P(C)P(D|C)P
(C^{c})P(D|C^{c})}{P(C)P(D^{c}|C)P(C^{c})P(D|C^{c})} = OR$$

\item Since $P(C, D)$ also equals $P(D)P(C|D)$, reversing the roles of $C$ and
$D$ in part $b$ gives the result.
