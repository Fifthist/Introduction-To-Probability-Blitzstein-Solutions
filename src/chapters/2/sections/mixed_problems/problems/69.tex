\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item $$y = dp + (1-d)(1-p)$$

\item The worst choice for $p$ is $\frac{1}{2}$, because then the fraction of
"yes" responses is $\frac{1}{2}$ irrespective of the fraction of drug users. In
other words, the number of "yes" responses tells us nothing.

\item We can extend the result from part $a$. 

A drug user says "yes" either if they get a "Have you used drugs" slip, or
if they get a "I was born in winter" slip and they are, in fact, born in winter.

A person who has not used drugs says "yes" only in the case that
they get a "I was born in winter" slip and they were, in fact,
born in winter.

$$y = d(p + \frac{1}{4}(1-p)) + (1-d)(1-p)\frac{1}{4}$$

Thus,

$$d = \frac{4y + p - 1}{2p}$$
