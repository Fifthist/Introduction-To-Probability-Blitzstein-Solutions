Let $D$ be the event that the mother has the disease. Let $C_{i}$ be the event
that the $i$-th child has the disease.

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item 
\begin{align*}
P(C_{1}^{c} \cap C_{2}^{c}) &= P(D)P(C_{1}^{c} \cap C_{2}^{c} | D) + P(D^{c})P
(C_{1}^{c} \cap C_{2}^{c} | D^{c}) \\
&= \frac{1}{3}*\frac{1}{4} + \frac{2}{3} \\
&= \frac{9}{12}
\end{align*}

\item The two events are not independent. If the elder child has the disease,
the mother has the disease, which means the younger child has probability $
\frac{1}{2}$ of having the disease. Unconditionally, the younger child has
probability $\frac{1}{6}$ of having the disease.

\item
\begin{align*}
P(D|C_{1}^{c} \cap C_{2}^{c}) &= \frac{P(D)P(C_{1}^{c} \cap C_{2}^{c} | D)}{P
(C_{1}^{c} \cap C_{2}^{c})} \\
&= \frac{\frac{1}{3}*\frac{1}{4}}{\frac{1}{3}*\frac{1}{4} + \frac{2}{3}} \\
&= \frac{1}{9}
\end{align*}
\end{enumerate}
