Let $R_{i}$, $G_{i}$, and $B_{i}$ be the events that the $i$-th drawn ball is
red, green or blue respectively. Let $A$ be the event that a green ball is drawn
before a blue ball.

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item 

Note that if a red ball is drawn, it is placed back, as if the experiment never
happened. Draws continue until a green or a blue ball is drawn. The red
balls are irrelevant in the experiment. Thus, the problem reduces to removing
all the red balls, and finding the probability of the first, randomly drawn ball
being green.
\begin{align*}
P(A) &= P(R_{1})P(A|R_{1}) + P(R_{1}^{c})P(A|R_{1}^{c}) \\
&= rP(A) + (g + b)\frac{g}{g + b} \\
&= rP(A) + g
\end{align*}

Thus, $$P(A) = \frac{g}{1-r} = \frac{g}{g + b}.$$ 

\item We are interested in draws in which the first ball is green. Each
completed sequence of $g+b+r$ draws is equally likely. Since the red balls are
once again irrelevant, we focus on the $g+b$ draws of green or blue balls.

Thus,

$$P(A) = \frac{\binom{g+b-1}{g-1}}{\binom{g+b}{g}} = \frac{g}{g+b}.$$

\item Let $A_{i,j}$ be the event that type $i$ occurs before type
$j$. Generalizing part $a$, we get 
$$P(A_{i,j}) = \frac{p_{i}}{p_{i}+p_{j}}.$$
