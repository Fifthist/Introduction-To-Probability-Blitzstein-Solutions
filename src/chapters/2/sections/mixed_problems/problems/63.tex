This problem is similar to the variations on example 2.2.5 (Two Children) in the
textbook.

It is true that conditioned on specific two of the three coins matching, the
probability of the third coin matching is $\frac{1}{2},$ but the way the problem
statement is phrased, \textit{at least two} of the coins match. According to the
Two Children problem, the result is no longer $\frac{1}{2}.$ In fact,
the probability of all the coins matching given at least two match is $\frac{1}
{4}.$
