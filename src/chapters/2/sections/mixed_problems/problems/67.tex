\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item Unconditionally, each of the $c + g + j$ donuts is equally likely to be
the last one. Thus, the probability that the last donut is a chocolate donut is
$\frac{c}{c + g + j}$.

\item We are interested in the event that the last donut is chocolate and the
last donut that is either glazed or jelly is jelly. The probability that the
last donut is chocolate is $\frac{c}{c + g + j}$. Since any ordering of glazed
and jelly donuts is equally likely, the probability that the last one is a jelly
donut is $\frac{j}{g + j}$. Thus, the probability of the desired event is
$\frac{c}{c + g + j}*\frac{j}{g + j}$.
