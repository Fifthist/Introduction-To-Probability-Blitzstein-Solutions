\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item All $(n+1)!$ permutations of the balls are equally likely, so the
probability that we draw the defective ball is $\frac{1}{n+1}$ irrespective of
when we choose to draw.

\item Consider the extreme case of the defective ball being super massive 
$(v >> nw)$. Then, it is more likely that a person draws the defective ball
rather than a non defective ball, so we want to draw last. On the other hand, 
if $v$ is much smaller than $nw$, then, at any stage of the experiment, 
drawing the defective ball is less likely than not, but after each draw of a 
non defective ball, the probability of it being drawn increases since there are
less balls left in the urn. Thus, we want to be one of the first ones to draw.

So the answer depends on the relationship of $w$ and $v$.
