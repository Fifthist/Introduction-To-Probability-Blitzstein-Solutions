Let $G_{i}$ be the event that the $i$-th door contains a goat, and let
$D_{i}$ be the event that Monty opens door $i$.

Let $S$ be the event of success under the specified strategy.

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item
\begin{align*}
P(S) &= P(G_{1})P(S|G_{1}) + P(G_{1}^{c})P(S|G_{1}^{c}) \\
&= \frac{2}{3}p + 0 \\
&= \frac{2}{3}p.
\end{align*}

Note that when $p=1$, the problem reduces to the basic Monty Hall problem,
and we get the correct solution $\frac{2}{3}$. In the case when $p=0$, Monty
never gives the contestant a chance to switch their initial, incorrect choice to
the correct one, resulting in a definite failure under the specified strategy.

\item
\begin{align*}
P(G_{1}|D_{2}) &= \frac{P(G_{1})P(D_{2}|G_{1})}{P(D_{2})} \\
&= \frac{P(G_{1})P(D_{2}|G_{1})}{P(G_{1})P(D_{2}|G_{1}) + P(G_{1}^{c})P(D_{2}|G_
{1}^{c})} \\
&= \frac{\frac{2}{6}p}{\frac{2}{6}p + \frac{1}{6}} \\
&= \frac{2p}{2p+1}.
\end{align*}

Note that if $p=1$, the problem reduces to the basic Monty Hall problem,
and the solution matches that of the basic, conditional Monty Hall problem.
If $p=0$ on the other hand, then the reason Monty has opened a door is
because the contestant's initial guess (Door $1$) is correct. By choosing the
strategy to switch, the contestant always loses. 
\end{enumerate}
