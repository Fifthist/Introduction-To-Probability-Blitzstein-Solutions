\item Since any applicant who is good at baseball is accepted to the college,
the proportion of admitted students good at baseball is higher than the
proportion of applicants good at baseball, because applicants include people who
aren't good at either math or baseball.

\item Let $S$ denote the sample space. Then,

$P(A|B,C) = P(A|B) = P(A) = P(A|S) < P(A|C)$.
