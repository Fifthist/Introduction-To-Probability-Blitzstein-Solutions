\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]

\item Since the second card is equally likely to be any of the remaining $3$ cards,
the probability that both cards are queens is $\frac{1}{3}$.

\item Our sample space now consists of all order pairs of the two queens and the two jacks,
where at least one card is a queen. Since all the outcomes are equally likely,
the answer is $\frac{2}{10} = \frac{1}{5}$.

\item Now, the sample space consists of all order pairs of the two queens and the two jacks,
where one of the cards is the Queen of Hearts. Thus, the answer is $\frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}$.
