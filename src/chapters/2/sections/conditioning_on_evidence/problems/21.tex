\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]

\item The sample space is $(H, H, H), (H, H, T), (H, T, H), (T, H, H)$. Since each
outcome is equally likely, the answer is $\frac{1}{4}$.

\item Since the last throw is independent of the first two, the probability
that all three throws landed heads given two of them landed heads equals
the probability that the third throw landed heads, which is $\frac{1}{2}$.
