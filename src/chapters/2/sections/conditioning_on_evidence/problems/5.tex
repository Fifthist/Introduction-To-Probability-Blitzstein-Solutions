By symmetry, all 50 of the remaining cards are equally likely. Thus, the probability that the third card is an ace is $\frac{3}{50}$.

We can reach the same answer using the definition of conditional probability. Let $A$ be the event that the first card is the Ace of Spades, $B$ be the event that the second card is the $8$ of Clubs and $C$ be the event that the third card is an ace. Then, $$P(C|A,B) = \frac{P(C,A,B)}{P(A,B)} = \frac{\frac{3*49!}{52!}}{\frac{50!}{52!}} = \frac{3}{50}$$
