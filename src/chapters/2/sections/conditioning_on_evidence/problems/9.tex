\item $P(A_{1}|B) = \frac{P(A_{1})P(B|A_{1})}{P(B)} = \frac{P(A_{1})}{P(B)} = \frac{P(A_{2})}{P(B)} \frac{P(A_{2})P(B|A_{2})}{P(B)} = P(A_{2}|B)$.

\item If $B$ is implied by both $A_{1}$ and $A_{2}$, knowing that $B$ occured does not tip the probability of occurence in favor of either $A_{1}$ or $A_{2}$.

For example, let $A_{1}$ be the event that the card in my hand is the Ace of Spades. Let $A_{2}$ be the event that the card in my hand is the Ace of Hearts. Let $B$ be the event that there are $3$ aces left in the deck.

$B$ is implied by both $A_{1}$ and $A_{2}$, and $P(A_{1}) = P(A_{2})$. Knowing that $B$ occured does not give one any information on whether they are holding the Ace of Spades or the Ace of Hearts, since $B$ would have occured in both cases. Thus, $P(A_{1}|B) = P(A_{2}|B)$.
