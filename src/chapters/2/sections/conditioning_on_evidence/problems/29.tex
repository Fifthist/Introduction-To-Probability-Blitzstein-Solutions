Let $G_{i}$ be the event that the $i$-th child is a girl. Let $C_{i}$ be the
event that the $i$-th child has property $C$.

$P(G_{1} \cap G_{2}|(G_{1} \cap C_{1} )\cup (G_{2} \cap C_{2})) = \frac{0.25
(2p - p^{2})}{0.5p+ 0.5p - 0.25p^{2}} = \frac{0.5(2-p)}{2-0.5p} = 
\frac{2-p}{4-p}.$

This result confirms the idea that the more rare characteristic $C$ is, the
closer we get to specifying which child we mean when we say that at least one of
the children has $C$.
