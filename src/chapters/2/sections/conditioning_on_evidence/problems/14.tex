\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]

\item Intuitively, $P(A|B) > P(A|B^{c})$, since Peter will be in a rush to 
install his alarm if he knows that his house will be burglarized before the 
end of next year.

\item Intuitively $P(B|A^{c}) > P(B|A)$, since Peter is more likely to be 
robbed if he doesn't have an alarm by the end of the year.

\item  See \url{https://math.stackexchange.com/a/3761508/649082}.

\item An explanation might be that in part $a$, we assume Peter to be driven 
to not let burglars rob him, but in part $b$ we assume the burglars to not 
necessarily be as driven, since we assume that if the burglers know that 
Peter will install an alaram before the end of the next year 
they might not rob him. If the burglers are driven, they might actually be 
more inclined to rob Peter sooner, before he actually installs the alarm.
