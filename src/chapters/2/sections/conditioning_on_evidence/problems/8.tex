Let $A_{1}$ be the event that the screen is produced by company $A$, $B_{1}$ be the event that the screen is produced by company $B$, and $C_{1}$ be the event that the screen is produced by company $C$. Let $D$ be the event that the screen is defective. 
\begin{flalign}
P(A_{1}|D) & = \frac{P(A_{1})P(D|A_{1})}{P(A_{1})P(D|A_{1}) + P(A_{1}^{c})P(D|A_{1}^{c})} \nonumber \\
& = \frac{P(A_{1})P(D|A_{1})}{P(A_{1})P(D|A_{1}) + P(A_{1}^{c})(P(B_{1}|A_{1}^{c})P(D|B_{1},A_{1}^{c}) + P(C_{1}|A_{1}^{c})P(D|C_{1},A_{1}^{c}))} \nonumber \\
