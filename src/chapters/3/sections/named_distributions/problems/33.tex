\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item The probability of a typo being caught is $p_{1} + p_{2} - p_{1}p_{2}$.
Then, $$P(X = k) = \binom{n}{k}(p_{1} + p_{2} - p_{1}p_{2})^{k}(1 - (p_{1} + p_
{2} - p_{1}p_{2}))^{n-k}$$

\item When we know the total number of caught typos in advance, the typos caught
by the first proofreader are no longer independent. For example, if we know that
first proofreader has caught the first $t$ typos, and the total number of caught
typos is $t$, then the probability of the first proofreader catching subsequent
typos is $0$, since the total number of caught typos was $t$.

Thus, we employ a Hypergeometric distribution. Since $p_{1} = p_{2}$, all $\binom{2n}{t}$ $t$-tuples of caught typos are equally likely. Hence,

$$P(X_{1} = k | X_{1} + X_{2} = t) = \frac{\binom{n}{k}\binom{n}{t-k}}{
\binom{2n}{t}}$$
