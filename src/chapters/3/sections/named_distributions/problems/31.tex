\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item Note that the distribution is not Binomial, since the guesses are not
independent of each other. If, for instance, the woman guesses the first three
cups to be milk-first, and she is correct, then the probability of her guessing
milk-first on subsequent guesses is $0$, since it is known in advance that there
are only $3$ milk-first cups.

Hypergeometric story fits. Let $X_{i}$ be the probability that the lady guesses
exactly $i$ milk-first cups correctly.

$$P(X_{i}) = \frac{\binom{3}{i}\binom{3}{3-i}}{\binom{6}{3}}$$

Thus, $P(X_{2}) + P(X_{3}) = \frac{10}{\binom{6}{3}} = \frac{1}{2}$

\item Let $M$ be the event that the cup is milk first, and let $T$ be the event
that the lady claims the cup is milk first. Then,

$$\frac{P(M|T)}{P(M^{c}|T)} = \frac{P(M)}{P(M^{c})}\frac{p_{1}}{1-p_{2}} = \frac{p_{1}}{1-p_{2}}$$
