Let $I_{i}$ be the indicator of the $i$-th person voting for Kodos.
Then, $P(I_{i}=1) = p_{1}p_{2}p_{3}.$ Since the voters make their decisions
independently, we have $n$ independent Bernoulli trials, which is precisely the
story for a Binomial distribution.

Thus,

$$P(X = k) = \binom{n}{k}(p_{1}p_{2}p_{3})^{k}(1- p_{1}p_{2}p_{3})^{n-k}$$
