\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item Let $C_{i}$ be the event that $i$-th type of coin is chosen. Let $H_{k}$
be the event that $k$ out of the $n$ flips land heads.

$$P(X = k) = P(C_{1})P(H_{k}|C_{1}) + P(C_{2})P(H_{k}|C_{2}) = \frac{1}{2}
\binom{n}{k}p_{1}^{k}(1-p_{1})^{n-k}+ \frac{1}{2}
\binom{n}{k}p_{2}^{k}(1-p_{2})^{n-k}$$

\item if $p_{1} = p_{2}$, then $X$ is Binomial $n$, $k$.

\item If $p_{1} \neq p_{2}$, then the Bernoulli trials are not independent. If,
for instance, $p_{1}$ is small and $p_{2}$ is large, and after the first
million flips we see two heads, this increases the likelihood that we are using
the coin with probability $p_{1}$ of landing heads, which in turn tells us that subsequent flips are unlikely to be land heads.
