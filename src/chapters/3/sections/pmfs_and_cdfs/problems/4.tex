To show that $F(x)$ is a CDF, we need to show that $F$ is increasing,
right-continuous, and converges to $0$ and $1$ in the limits.

The first condition is true since $\lfloor x \rfloor$ is increasing.

Since $\lim_{x \to a^{+}} F(x) = F(a)$ when $a \in \mathbb{N}$ by the 
definition of $F(x)$, the second condition is satisfied.

$\lim_{x \to \infty}F(x) = 1$ by the definition of $F(x)$, and also, by
definition, $\lim_{x \to -\infty}F(x) = 0$. Thus, the third condition is
satisfied, and $F(x)$ is a CDF.

The PMF $F$ corresponds to is

$$P(X = k) = \frac{1}{n}$$ for $1 \leq k \leq n$ and $0$ everywhere else.
