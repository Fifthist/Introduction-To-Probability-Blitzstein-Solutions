\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item Let $P(n) = \frac{k}{n}$ for $n \in \mathbb{N}$. By principles of
probability, $\sum_{n \in \mathbb{N}}P(n)$ must equal $1$.

$$\sum_{n \in \mathbb{N}}P(n) = k\sum_{n \in \mathbb{N}}\frac{1}{n}.$$ The sum
on the right side of the equality is a divergent, harmonic series. Hence. the
aforementioned principle of probably is violated. Contradiction.

\item $\sum_{n \in \mathbb{N}}\frac{1}{n^{2}} = \frac{\pi^{2}}{6}$. Thus,
letting $k$ equal $\frac{6}{\pi^{2}}$, the principle of probability is
satisfied.
