$F(x) = pF_{1}(x) + (1-p)F_{2}(x)$.

Let $x_{1} < x_{2}$. Then $$F(x_{1}) = pF_{1}(x_{1}) + (1-p)F_{2}(x_{1}) < pF_
{1}(x_{2}) + (1-p)F_{2}(x_{2}) = F(x_{2}).$$

Since $F(x)$ is a weighted sum of right continuous functions, it is itself a
right continuous function.

$$\lim_{x \to \infty} F(x) = p\lim_{x \to \infty} F_{1}(x) + (1 - p)\lim_{x \to
\infty} F_{2}(x) = p + 1 - p = 1.$$

Similarly, $$\lim_{x \to -\infty}F(x) = 0.$$

\item
Let $X$ be an r.v. created as described. Let $H$ be the event that coin
lands heads, and $T$ be the event that the coin lands tails.

Then, $F(X=k) = P(H)F_{1}(k) + P(T)F_{2}(k) = pF_{1}(k) + (1-p)F_{2}(k).$

Note that this is the same CDF as in part $a$.
