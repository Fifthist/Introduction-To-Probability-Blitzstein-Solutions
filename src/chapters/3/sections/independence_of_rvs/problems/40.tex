\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item $X$ and $Y$ need not have the same PMF. For example, let $Y$ represent my
answer to the question, "What is the capital of Zimbabwe?" I believe it to be
Harare with probability $\frac{3}{4}$, but I am not certain, so with probability
$\frac{1}{4}$, I think it may be Bulawayo.

Tom on the other hand knows for a fact (probability of $1$) that the captial of
Zimbabwe is Harare.

Suppose Tom gets asked first. I trust Tom, so I will always go with Tom's answer
once I hear it. Letting $X$ and $Y$ be my and Tom's answers to the question, $P
(X=Y) = 1$, but the PMFs of $X$ and $Y$ are different.


\item If $P(X=Y) = 1$, then $X$ and $Y$ can not be independent,
the outcome of one fixes the outcome of the other.
