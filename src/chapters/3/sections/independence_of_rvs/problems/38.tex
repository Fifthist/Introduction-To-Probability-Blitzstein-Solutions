\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item Let $Y = X + 1$. Then, $X$ and $Y$ are clearly dependent, and $P(X < Y) =
1$.

\item Let $X$ be the value of a toss of a six sided die, with values $1$ to $6$.
Let $Y$ be the value of a toss of a six sided die, with values $7$ to $12$.
Tosses of the two die are independent, but $P(X < Y) = 1$.
