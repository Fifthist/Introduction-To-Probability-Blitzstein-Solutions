# Probability and Counting

## Counting
  
###

__Intuition__

There are 11 slots to put letters into. We have one $M$, four $I$, four $S$, and two $P$. Then, there are ${11 \choose 1}$ ways to place the $M$, ${10 \choose 4}$ ways to place $I$, ${6 \choose 4}$ ways to place the $S$, and ${2 \choose 2}$ ways to place the $P$.

__Solution__

$$ {11 \choose 1} \times {10 \choose 4} \times {6 \choose 4} \times {2 \choose 2} $$

###

(a) __Intuition__

If the first digit can't be $0$ or $1$, we are left with $8$ choices for the first digit. The remaining six digits can by any digits.

(a) __Solution__

$$ 8 \times 10^{6} $$


(b) __Intuition__ 

We can subtract the number of seven digits phone numbers that start with $911$ from the total number of phone numbers we found in the previous part. 

If a phone number starts with $911$, it has ten choices for each of the remaining four digits.

(b) __Solution__

$$ 8 \times 10^{6} - 10^{4} $$

### 

(a) __Intuition__

Fred has $10$ choices for Monday, $9$ choices for Tuesday, $8$ choices for Wednesday, $7$ choices for Thursday and $6$ choices for Friday.

(a) __Solution__

$$ 10 \times 9 \times 8 \times 7 \times 6 $$

(b) __Intution__

For the first restaurant, Fred has $10$ choices. For all subsequent days, Fred has $9$ choices, sinces he doesn't want to eat at the restaurant he ate at the previous day.

(b) __Solution__

$$ 10 \times 9^{4} $$

###

(a) __Intuition__

There are ${n \choose 2}$ matches in a round-robin setting. For a given match, there are two outcomes. Irrespective of the outcome, the next match also has two possible outcomes. Hence, we can use the multiplication rule to count the total possible outcomes.

(a) __Solution__

$$ 2^{{n \choose 2}} $$


(b) __Intuition__

Since every player plays every other player exactly once, the number of games is the number of ways to pair up $n$ people.

(b) __Solution__

$$ {n \choose 2} $$
